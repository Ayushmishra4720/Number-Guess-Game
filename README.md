# Number-Guess-Game
This repository contains a simple Number Guessing Game implemented in Java. It is a beginner-friendly console-based project where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a certain range. After each guess, the program provides feedback on whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
